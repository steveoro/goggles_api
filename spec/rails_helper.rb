# == SimpleCov: Test coverage report formatter ==
# [Steve A., 20201030]
# SimpleCov prepares a static HTML code-coverage report inside '/coverage';
# the formatter is used by both CodeClimate.com & CodeCov.io build configurations.
#
# - CodeCov repot........: sent by its gem if the ENV variable CODECOV_TOKEN is set
# - CodeClimate report...: sent by using its stand-alone 'cc-test-reporter' utility
# - CoverAlls report.....: no longer maintained & gem dependency removed
#
# See: https://github.com/steveoro/goggles_db/wiki/HOWTO-dev-code_coverage_setup

# Requires supporting ruby files with custom matchers and macros, etc, in
# spec/support/ and its subdirectories. Files matching `spec/**/*_spec.rb` are
# run as spec files by default. This means that files in spec/support that end
# in _spec.rb will both be required and run as specs, causing the specs to be
# run twice. It is recommended that you do not name files matching this glob to
# end with _spec.rb. You can configure this pattern with the --pattern
# option on the command line or in ~/.rspec, .rspec or `.rspec-local`.
#
# The following line is provided for convenience purposes. It has the downside
# of increasing the boot-up time by auto-requiring all files in the support
# directory. Alternatively, in the individual `*_spec.rb` files, manually
# require only the support files necessary.
#
# Add support files directly from Core engine and then from current app:
# Dir[GogglesDb::Engine.root.join('spec', 'support', '**', '*.rb')].sort.each { |f| require f }
Rails.root.glob('spec/support/**/*.rb').each { |f| require f }

# Checks for pending migrations and applies them before tests are run.

  #
  #     RSpec.describe UsersController, type: :controller do
  #       # ...
